The **#LopenInGent project** is an effort to create an *enjoyable, customizable and dynamic running app* for the city of **Ghent**. Here's a showcase of our **major features**: 

- Running **route generation** based on a **distance or an amount of time** (eg. I want to run 5 km or I want to run for 30 minutes)

- Route **recalculation** if you go off the given route, the recalculation will be within the distance/time constraint.

- Routes always go **back to the starting point**, it will never take the same route to go back.

- It's possible to **add distance or time while you're running**.

- Users can select **multiple attributes for a given run**. (eg. I want to run on soft ground or I want to run next to parks)

- **Audio guidance** while you are running (Heartrate feedback, directions, ...)

- Keep track of your **running statistics** and previous runs.
